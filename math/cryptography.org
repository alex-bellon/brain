- encryption without padding is insecure
  - encryption: saep, oaep+
  - signature: pss
  - diffie hellman relies on:
    - discrete log problem
    - computational dh problem
    - decisional dh problem
    - use this setting for public key crypto (cramer-shoup) or signatures (schnorr, dsa). mostly used for dh though.
    - really for this setting you just need a group g = of prime order q when ddh problem is hard
    - can also get this structure from the group of points of an elliptic curve
      - advantages
        - much smaller parameters
        - much more efficient operations
        - picking parameters is easier and less error-prone
      - modern protocols use
        - ecdh for key exchange
        - ecdsa, rsa (legacy) for signatures
  - mod p, every invertible element has order dividing p-1 (with operation multiplication)

**** keygen
- pick primes p, q

  - set n = pq
  - set e = 65537
  - compute d s.t. e * d ≡ 1 mod (p - 1)(q - 1)

  **** rsa function
  - f: (*z*/n*z*)x -> (*z*/n*z*)x
  - f: x -> xe mod n
  - f-1: y -> yd mod n

  **** hard problems
  - *factoring*: given n, find p and q
  - *rsa problem*: given n, e, y, find x s.t.xe = y

  **** signatures from rsa
  - *keygen*: pubkey = (n, e), seckey = d
  - *sign m*: σ = [pack(m)]d mod n, pack in (*z*/n*z*)x
  - *verify*: σe ≡ pack(m) mod n

  **** encryption from rsa
  k <- ae keyspace
  c = e pack(k)e mod n

  *decrypt*: e unpack(cd mod n) to get x
