** logistics
- running a meeting
  > running meetings properly is a rare skill, so we've summarized the key
  points here -- this particular skill is valuable in most walks of life.
  several days before the meeting, the organizer of the meeting should:
  • circulate the agenda;
  • check that the venue is still available, if it isn't the supervisor's office;
  • remind people of the time and place of the meeting;
  • circulate any briefing material, including minutes of the last meeting.
  during the meeting, the chair of the meeting should:
  • record the date and the parties present;
  • check that everyone agrees with the minutes of the last meeting;
  • check that actions from the last meeting have all been done;
  • record any decisions made, including milestones and deliverables (and check that everyone agrees with this record);
  • record any actions agreed (and check that everyone agrees with this record);
  • fix the time and place of the next meeting.
  after the meeting:
  • the organizer should write up the minutes and distribute them;
  • everyone should do what they have agreed to do.
