* How Can We Effectively Test Transient Execution Mitigations
- Transient execution
  - Specifically refers to mispredictions
  - Execute instructions that don't get committed
- How are these problems fixed
  - Microarch changes
  - New instructions
  - Firmware/microcode updates
  - Kernel patches
- Hard to tell with X CPU, Y microcode and Z distro whether you're vulnerable
