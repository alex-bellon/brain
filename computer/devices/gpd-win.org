heck, i drop mine all the way to 2.5 watts for stardew valley, baldur's gate, system shock 2 and some other titles lol i mostly play older favorites over the years so i mostly game with low tdp. i'll set my win 2 at 3.5 watts which is the setting i use for games like the mass effect series and dragon age origins and some other light 3d gaming.

combined with a 30 fps cap, 2.5 watts, low screen brightness and little to no background apps, i can game for a good 8 hours depending on the title. desktop usage is closer to 10 hours.

i'm not the average use case for this machine i don't think. didn't stop me from getting the third cooling mod though lol 2.5 watts and that thing installed, woo boy. nice and cool!
