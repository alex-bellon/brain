*** edit wsl files from windows with sftp
i just hit on a way to edit files in wsl that in retrospect seems really obvious. i'm wondering if there's some reason it's a bad idea or if alternately people know about it.

the problem i'm trying to solve is editing files in the linux partition of wsl from windows. ie: editing $home/.bashrc with notepad. we're told to absolutely never change the linux filesystem files from windows because things can break.

so my solution is to [[https://gist.github.com/dentechy/de2be62b55cfd234681921d5a8b6be11][run the sshd daemon]] under wsl. then use that to connect to my linux files via [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ssh_file_transfer_protocol][sftp]] running as a windows app. i'm using [[https://www.sftpnetdrive.com][sftp net drive]] to mount my linux files as a windows drive, there are other options. then use any windows program to edit the files in that drive, like notepad or sublime text.

all the actual file i/o is happening under wsl thanks to sftp, so it should be safe. sftp imposes some overhead but it's not a big deal for just editing files. one nice thing is sftp seems to do a pretty good job at preserving unix file permissions even when editing from windows.
