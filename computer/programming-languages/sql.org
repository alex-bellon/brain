** learn
there's knowing sql and then /knowing/ sql. it's one thing to be able to do simple crud operations with sql, but stuff like the following is much rarer and more valuable: - complex aggregations (=aggregate() filter (where ...)=) - window functions (=row_number() over (partition by ...)=) - ctes (=with some_query as (...) select from some_query ...=) - using =exists= properly in where clauses for performance - knowing which types of where clauses are detrimental to performance - knowing the details of how various combinations of joins will improve or harm performance - knowing how to properly design schemas - knowing how to correctly index tables for the queries used
