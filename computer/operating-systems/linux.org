*** resetting passwords
**** if you're not logged in (and the disk isn't encrypted)
- boot into grub, hit =e= to edit the grub config for only this boot
  - in the line that starts with 'linux' change =ro= to =rw= and add =init=/bin/sh= at the end of that line
- =ctrl= + =x= to exit, then boot normally
- reset your password with =passwd=
  - you might also have to run =mount -o remount,rw /= to make the filesystem writable. this command remounts =/= (root filesystem) in place
- or, you can create a new user without a password by running =vi /etc/shadow= and adding a line like =alex::18159::::::= (username is alex, no password)
- run =sync= to flush changes
- reboot
